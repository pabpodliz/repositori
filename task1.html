    <h1>Seville, the capital of Andalusia, is one of Spain's most appreciated places abroad. Although its Moorish architectural 
        influence is most striking, - since it was occupied by the Moors for some 800 years - long before that it had been a cultural
         center of great importance.</h1>
    <h2>The fertility of its soil and its favorable climate with mild winters and about 3,000 hours of sunshine per year.</h2>
    <h3>The best itineraries to discover the monuments, museums, churches and convents and everything that makes Seville worthy of a visit.</h3>
